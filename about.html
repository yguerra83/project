            <div class="history-text">
                <p>Originating in Pembrokeshire, Wales, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an enchanting dog whose background
                    is
                    steeped
                    in folklore. According to Welsh legend, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi sprang from the lairs of fairies
                    and
                    elves!
                </p>

                <p>As the legend goes, one day two children were out in the fields tending to their family's cattle when
                    they
                    found
                    a couple of puppies. The children thought they were foxes, but recognizing something different about
                    them,
                    bundled them up and took them home. Their parents immediately saw that the pups were not foxes, but
                    dogs,
                    and
                    told their children that the pups were a gift from the fairies that lived in the fields. The fairies
                    used
                    them
                    to pull their carriages and sometimes ride into battle.</p>

                <p>As proof that Pembrokes were indeed the mounts of fairies, the parents pointed to the marks on their
                    backs
                    where
                    the fairy saddle had been placed on their shoulders. The children were delighted and cherished their
                    pups.
                    As
                    they grew, the dogs became treasured companions and learned to help the children take care of the
                    family's
                    cattle.</p>

                <p>For those who don't believe in fairy tales, there are historians who say that the Pembroke Welsh
                    Corgi is
                    descended from Vallhunds, Swedish cattle dogs that were brought to Wales by the Vikings in the 9th
                    and
                    10th
                    centuries. Others think they may have been descended from dogs that were brought to Wales by Flemish
                    weavers
                    in
                    the 12th century.</p>

                <p>Either way, the breed has a rather misty historical pedigree. Farmers who kept working dogs in the
                    past
                    bred
                    the
                    best dogs for the jobs they wanted them to do. They didn't keep good records about the matings.</p>

                <p>In the 1920s, the UK Kennel Club recognized Corgis as purebred dogs. They were officially known as
                    Welsh
                    Corgis
                    when exhibited for the first time in 1925. At that time, Pembrokes and Cardigans were shown in the
                    same
                    class as
                    one breed.</p>

                <p>Then, in 1934, the Kennel Club recognized the Pembroke and the Cardigan as two separate breeds. In
                    that
                    same
                    year, the American Kennel Club followed suit. Pembrokes were first shown in the U.S. in 1936.</p>

                <p>Pembrokes have slowly gained in popularity in the U.S., and today, are among the top 50 most popular
                    breeds
                    for
                    family pets. They're also popular with Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II of England, who received her
                    first
                    Pembroke Welsh Corgi from her father (King George VI) in 1933.</p>

                <p>The puppy's name was Rozavel Golden Eagle and was a playmate for Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret.
                    Elizabeth
                    has loved the little dogs ever since, and currently has a pack of them lounging around Buckingham
                    Palace.
