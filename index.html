                        Welsh Corgis come in <a href="varities.html">two varieties:</a> the Pembroke and the Cardigan.
                        They were registered as one
                        breed
                        by
                        the
                        Kennel Club in the U.K. until 1934, although many breeders believe the two breeds developed
                        separately.
                        Both
                        have similar heads, bodies, levels of intelligence and herding ability, but the Cardigan is
                        slightly
                        larger
                        and heavier boned than the Pembroke.</p>

                    <p>For most of us, the easiest way to tell the difference between a Pembroke and a Cardigan is to
                        look
                        at
                        the
                        tails. Pembrokes' are docked and Cardigans' are long. (Remember it this way: the Pembroke has a
                        "broke"
                        tail; the Cardigan has a long tail like the sleeves of a cardigan sweater.</p>

                    <p>Pembroke Welsh Corgis (also called Pembrokes, PWCs or Pems) are the smallest of the American
                        Kennel
                        Club's
                        Herding Group, and are also recognized by the United Kennel Club. Their coats can be red, sable,
                        fawn or
                        tri-colored (red, black and tan), usually with white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle
                        and
                        belly.
                        They also may have a narrow blaze on their heads. Pembroke heads are shaped much like the head
                        of a
                        fox.
                        Their eyes are oval-shaped and dark, and their ears are erect.

                        The official AKC breed standard is maintained by the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club of America.
